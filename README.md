I have always been frustrated by hunderds of tabs accumulating in Chrome, becoming infinitesimally small and completely unaccessible. I envisioned a tab manager that would allow you to become truly efficient with your browsing, a manager that would allow you to do the following:

1) Look at a screenshot of your all your open tabs (like Mission Control on a Mac) to easily switch to the one you need.

2) Move tabs from one window to another or delete them by dragging them around.

3) Store lists of related tabs (browsing sessions) that you can reopen later to avoid unwanted Chrome windows cluttering your desktop and hogging CPU resources. 

4) Snooze tabs for later viewing. 

I got together with a group of friends to implement this tab manager during last fall's PennApps, and [this is the demo we submitted](http://www.youtube.com/embed/0_4QGGPXQgA).
